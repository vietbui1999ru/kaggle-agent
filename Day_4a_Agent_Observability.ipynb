        "2. **Traces:** A trace connects the logs into a single story, showing you **why** a final result occurred by revealing the entire sequence of steps.\n",
        "3. **Metrics:** Metrics are the summary numbers (like averages and error rates) that tell you **how** well the agent is performing overall.\n",
