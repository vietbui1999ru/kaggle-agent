    "**Welcome to the Kaggle 5-day Agents course!**\n",

    "This notebook is your first step into building AI agents. An agent can do more than just respond to a prompt — it can **take actions** to find information or get things done.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you'll:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ Install [Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/)\n",
    "- ✅ Configure your API key to use the Gemini model\n",
    "- ✅ Build your first simple agent\n",
    "- ✅ Run your agent and watch it use a tool (like Google Search) to answer a question\n",

    "\n",
    "> ❌ **ℹ️ Note: No submission required!**\n",
    "> This notebook is for your hands-on practice and learning only. You **do not** need to submit it anywhere to complete the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ⏸️ **Note:**  When you first start the notebook via running a cell you might see a banner in the notebook header that reads **\"Waiting for the next available notebook\"**. The queue should drop rapidly; however, during peak bursts you might have to wait a few minutes.\n",

    "> ❌ **Note:** Avoid using the **Run all** cells command as this can trigger a QPM limit resulting in 429 errors when calling the backing model.
